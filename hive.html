                <p>Looking back on this project, it was definitely difficult to thoroughly create a product in just nine weeks.
                    However, it was a great learning experience for our team. We learned a lot about the user centered design process as
                    well as the beekeeping process. It was great to bond together as complete strangers and collaborate as a team over a
                    long-term project. <br><br>Throughout the process, there were some moments where I felt that we were a little rushed
                    and were not able to do exactly what we wanted. For the usability testing, I wish we would have had time to schedule
                    user testing with beekeepers themselves to see how effective and feasible our product would be for them. I also
                    would
                    have liked more time to create higher fidelity mockups. But, these issues were great learning experiences as well
                    that taught me the time constraints of research and testing in industry that I will have to face.</p>
