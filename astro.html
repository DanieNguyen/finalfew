                <p>For an HCI course, I worked with a team for three CSE students to go through the user-centered design process. During the three months of the course, we conducted user research through interviews, ideated and designed from low fidelity to high fidelity, and tested with users and classmates. </p>
                <p>Our team designed Astro for dog owners who can be away from home for long periods of time like a full work day or vacations. Astro is a robot companion for dogs and dog owners that allows dog owners to feed, let out, and play with their dogs remotely. Astro is an innovative product that tackles a uniqie problem space and provides a one-in-all solution for dog owners.</p>

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>When dog owners are away, their dogs often need to be left at home. On long work days and business trips, dogs are left at home, unmonitored. Relatives or dog walkers may stop by, but no one will be keeping the dog safe 100% of the time. We want to create a product that helps these dog owners in providing the right care for their dogs.</p>
                <h3>The Audience</h3>
                <p>The primary target users of our product are hard-working industry professionals who are away from home for long periods of time and own pets. These users are either often working late or work in an industry that travels frequently. Secondary users include people/families who travel a lot and own pets and would rather leave their pet at home than leaving them in the care of another person.</p>
                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>To begin our project, we conducted user research to discover what problems and pain points dog owners have with their daily lives of taking care of their dogs.</p>
                <h4>Methods</h4>
                <p>We conducted semi-structured interviews spanning about two weeks with four dog owners. We learned about their different concerns and found the main concerns dog owners had was worrying about their dogs eating or being let out when the owners were away.</p>
                <h4>Findings</h4>
                <p>We found that our participants had many positive elements with taking care of their dogs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most of our participants have a care taking system in place where the dogs are usually not left alone for longer than a couple of hours.</li>
                    <li>Most of our participants have used or currently use a dog walker when leaving their dogs for extended periods of time.</li>
                    <li>All of our participants either use some method of direct or indirect observation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, we also discovered several pain points for these dog owners.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dog owners still worry about their dogs when they are away and do not necessarily feel comfortable with their existing care taking systems.</li>
                    <li>Dog owners worry about their eating habits and outdoor activity when away.</li>
                    <li>Some dog owners also avoid traveling to not leave their dogs in the care of someone else.</li>
                    <li>Dog owners also desired more interaction between the dogs and themselves even when away at work or traveling.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our teamâ€™s goal was to alleviate these pain points for dog owners.</p>
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>Moving forward with our research, we conducted a thematic analysis of our interview transcripts. From our thematic analysis, we identified 6 salient tasks that dog owners engaged in.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Feeding Dogs</li>
                    <li>Letting Dogs In and Out</li>
                    <li>Monitoring Dogs</li>
                    <li>Maintaing Health of Dogs</li>
                    <li>Traveling by Car with Dogs</li>
                    <li>Traveling by Plane with Dogs</li>
                </ol>
                <p>For this project, our team decided to address the first four tasks because they were considered more important from our participants. In addition, traveling was not common among our participants so our team moved forward with a product meant for the home, to be able to impact a larger population of dog owners. </p>
                <p>With the four tasks of feeding, letting dogs in or out, monitoring dogs, and maintaining the health of dogs in mind. We brainstormed different products to address these tasks. Our three main ideas were a robot, smart collar, and smart crate.</p>
                <p>After much deliberation, we moved forward with the robot because of the competitive, redundant products for the collar and the lack of popularity with crates among dog owners shown in online research.</p>
                <h3>The Design</h3>
                <p>Our concept is a robot that is able to accomplish the sorts of tasks necessary to properly care for a dog left at home by itself. This means being generally autonomous, and capable of navigating the terrain of a home. Being able to recognize what the various objects that occupy a home, and to interact with them in meaningful ways. The robot has to be able to locate and open doors, recognize and monitor the dog, locate toys and use them to play with the dog, locate food dishes and dispense food into them. Furthermore, it must have a system or programming and control that is intuitive and easy to operate for all users. Toward that end, we elected to have an app that can be run on computers or mobile devices that is the primary means of interacting with the robot. This application allows the user to initially program the robot so that it is familiar with the home in which it will be operating, and then to schedule the events that will accomplish those tasks which the user needs to be done while they are away from home. These tasks can be done autonomously by the robot, or if the user desires, activated and controlled manually by the user through specific controls.</p>
