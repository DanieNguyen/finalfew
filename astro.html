                        <p>For an HCI course, I worked with a team for three CSE students to go through the user-centered design process. During the three months of the course, we conducted user research through interviews, ideated and designed from low fidelity to high fidelity, and tested with users and classmates. </p>
                        <p>Our team designed Astro for dog owners who can be away from home for long periods of time like a full work day or vacations. Astro is a robot companion for dogs and dog owners that allows dog owners to feed, let out, and play with their dogs remotely. </p>

                <p>To begin our project, we conducted user research to discover what problems and pain points dog owners have with their daily lives of taking care of their dogs.</p><br>
                <h4>Methods</h4>
                <p>We conducted semi-structured interviews spanning about two weeks with four dog owners. We learned about their different concerns and found the main concerns dog owners had was worrying about their dogs eating or being let out when the owners were away.</p>

                        <p>Our team also looked at various existing dog care products such as Furbo, smart collars, and smart crates. We found that at most, the products only accomplished two of the tasks we defined. For example, Furbo allows users to feed their dogs and monitor them, but can't really let their dogs out or maintain their health.</p>

                        <h2 class="astro">Astro is a robot companion for dogs and dog owners that allows dog owners to feed, let out, and play with their dogs remotely.</h2>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Our solution is a robot that is able to accomplish the sorts of tasks necessary to properly care for a dog left at home by itself. The robot has to be able to locate and open doors, recognize and monitor the dog, locate toys and use them to play with the dog, locate food dishes and dispense food into them. </p>
                        <p>Users will interact with the robot through a mobile application. The app allows the user to program the robot, schedule events while they are away from home. These tasks can be done autonomously by the robot, and controll the robot manually</p>

                            <p>
                                With our design concept in mind, we set out to create low-fidelity prototypes to test and flesh out our concept. Because of the time constraints of this project, our team mainly focused on creating the mobile app companion for the robot.

                            <h4>Robot Prototype</h4>
                            <p>Our team did not prioritize prototyping the robot, because we already “have” an existing prototype and model existing with Boston Dynamic’s SpotMini.</p>
                            <h4>Mobile App Prototype</h4>
                            <p>Users will interact with the robot through a mobile application. The app allows the user to program the robot, schedule events while they are away from home. These tasks can be done autonomously by the robot, and controll the robot manually</p>
