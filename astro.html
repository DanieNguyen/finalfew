                <p>The primary audience of our product are hard-working industry professionals who are away from home for long periods of time and own pets. This group of people are either often working late or work in an industry that travels frequently. The problem also affects people/families who travel a lot and own pets and would rather leave their pet at home than leaving them in the care of another person.</p>

                <p>To begin our project, we conducted user research to discover what problems and pain points dog owners have with their daily lives of taking care of their dogs.</p>
                <p>We conducted semi-structured interviews spanning about two weeks with four dog owners. We learned about their different concerns and found the main concerns dog owners had was worrying about their dogs eating or being let out when the owners were away.</p>

                <p class="caption">Sarah is a receptionist who works at a dental office. She lives with her husband and has two three year old dogs, named Pickle and Grape. Every morning, before work she packs breakfast for herself and her husband and then takes care of the dogs. Pickle and Grape get their breakfast and then she lets them go outside. Sometimes, she can be late to work because of her Pickle in particular does not obey her commands to go out or come in, which in turn inspires Grape to follow suit. If she doesn’t let her dogs out, there is guaranteed to be an accident when she comes home later, and so it is important that they go out in the mornings. However, her dogs often do not wish to come inside because of their tendencies to chase squirrels. Sarah desires a method to assist with her dogs’ outside behavior and help her time when to let the dogs in and out. </p>

                <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
                <p>With the four tasks of feeding, letting dogs in or out, monitoring dogs, and maintaining the health of dogs in mind. We brainstormed different products to address these tasks. </p>
                <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
                <p>Our team also looked at various existing dog care products such as Furbo, smart collars, and smart crates. We found that at most, the products only accomplished two of the tasks we defined. For example, Furbo allows users to feed their dogs and monitor them, but can't really let their dogs out or maintain their health.</p>
                <p>Our three main ideas were a robot, smart collar, and smart crate.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>Our solution is a robot that is able to accomplish the sorts of tasks necessary to properly care for a dog left at home by itself. The robot has to be able to locate and open doors, recognize and monitor the dog, locate toys and use them to play with the dog, locate food dishes and dispense food into them. </p>
                <p>Users will interact with the robot through a mobile application. The app allows the user to program the robot, schedule events while they are away from home. These tasks can be done autonomously by the robot or manually with the app controls.</p>

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>We set out to create low-fidelity prototypes to test and flesh out our concept. Because of the time constraints of this project, our team mainly focused on creating the mobile app companion for the robot.

                <h4>Robot Prototype</h4>
                <p><img class="floright robot" src="images/robot.jpg">Because of the course project's flexibility in implementation, our team did not prototype the robot. We already “have” an existing prototype and model existing with Boston Dynamic’s SpotMini, since it has all the functionality necessary to achieve our desired tasks. </p>
                <h4>Mobile App Prototype</h4>
                <p>For our mobile app prototypes, creating our interface on paper allowed us to refine and formulate the design without too much investment. This allowed us to revise the app design several times. Testing with our potential users helped refine it further.</p>

                <h3>Heuristic Evaluations</h3>
                <p>With our paper prototypes, we first tested them with classmates, using heuristic evaluations. Our classmates examined our prototype with Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics. Our feedback from the evaluations showed many improvements to be made. We had several issues needed to fix such as adding in a navigation icon for the home page, making the language and design more consistent between screens, and making it clear what to do in the case of errors when conducting a task or deleting an event.</p>

                <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                <p>After revisions from our evaluations, we conducted three usability tests with dog owners, asking them to do a series of tasks. As for the methods used, we had a task list that we wanted our users to walk us through doing, using our paper prototype application. The tasks for our users included opening and closing the doors to let their dog out, feeding their dogs, playing with their dogs, seeing a live feed of their dogs and manually controlling that feed, creating an event, and taking a picture and a clip of their dog.</p>

                <p>This project taught me a lot about the more technical side of the design process because of my professor's, TA's, and team member's backgrounds in computer science. I also learned how to effectively advocate for human-centered design with those unfamiliar with it. I had a wonderful time with this project and hope that it might actually come true when the SpotMini doesn't cost over $20,000.</p>

                <p>Our initial problem space was to address problems for people who travel with their pets by plane. However, when screening for interviews, we were unable to find participants in this problem space and had to shift to a new problem space. I learned to be flexible with ideas and not be stuck to a single one.</p>

                <h4 class="astro">Language Helps Learnability</h4>
                <p>With our project, one of the main issues we came across was language. Setting a consistent language system across a product helped with learnability. We found this out from both rounds of testing with inconsistencies such as using "Done" versus "Exit."</p>

                <p>This was my first project where my team had large disagreements on how to proceed forward at certain parts. However, I found that as long as we communicated respectfully, we came to a deeper understanding of our project as a team and had greater ideas after a disagreement.</p>
