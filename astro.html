                <p>Our solution is a robot that is able to accomplish the sorts of tasks necessary to properly care for a dog left at home by itself. The robot has to be able to locate and open doors, recognize and monitor the dog, locate toys and use them to play with the dog, locate food dishes and dispense food into them. </p>
                <p>Users will interact with the robot through a mobile application. The app allows the user to program the robot, schedule events while they are away from home. These tasks can be done autonomously by the robot, and controll the robot manually</p>

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>
                    With our design concept in mind, we set out to create low-fidelity prototypes to test and flesh out our concept. Because of the time constraints of this project, our team mainly focused on creating the mobile app companion for the robot.
                </p>
                <h4>Robot Prototype</h4>
                <p><img class="floright robot" src="images/robot.jpg">Our team did not prioritize prototyping the robot, because we already “have” an existing prototype and model existing with Boston Dynamic’s SpotMini. The SpotMini has all the functionality necessary to achieve our desired tasks.</p>
                <h4>Mobile App Prototype</h4>
                <p>For our prototypes, creating our interface on paper allowed us to refine and formulate the design without too much investment. This allowed us to revise the app design several times. Testing with our potential users helped refine it further. To show the full process, we’ll go over our tasks in our initial prototype, what we changed, and finally the same task views in our final paper and digital prototypes.
                </p><p>Our app is based on a design of five screens: a home page, a live page, a schedule page, a settings page, and a media library page. The user starts out on the home screen and proceeds to tap on one of the buttons on the bottom to continue.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>Our team first conducted heuristic evaluations with our classmates then usability testing with our target users.</p>
                <h4>Heuristic Evaluations</h4>
                <p>Our feedback from the evaluations showed many improvements to be made. We had several issues needed to fix such as adding in a navigation icon for the home page, making the language and design more consistent between screens, and making it clear what to do in the case of errors when conducting a task or deleting an event.</p>
                <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
                <p>With user testing, we were able to improve our interface usability greatly. We conducted three usability tests with dog owners, asking them to do a series of tasks. Our participants were chosen purposefully. We utilized our TA for expert-based testing and we used two other dog owners for our user-based testing. As for the methods used, we had a task list that we wanted our users to walk us through doing, using our paper prototype application. The tasks for our users included opening and closing the doors to let their dog out, feeding their dogs, playing with their dogs, seeing a live feed of their dogs and manually controlling that feed, creating an event, and taking a picture and a clip of their dog.</p>
                <p>
                The revisions we made after user testing reflected the feedback we received. We made each screen match each other by making a consistent home bar at the bottom. We cleared up some of the terms we used that confused our users, such as continue when we wanted to inform our users to confirm the action they’ve selected. We also made the task of creating and deleting an event much smoother and we made it easier to take a picture or a video of your dog using our product.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <h3>Revisions</h3>
                <p>Our live page with manual controls went through many revisions, changing the wording for manual actions, and the dialogs for those actions.</p>
                <p>
                After tapping the “Door” button on the manual page, we presented the a dialog hovering over the control section. Our initial dialog had confusing wording, and it took us several iterations to figure this out.
                </p>
                <p>The “Scheduling” page in our original prototype was redundant with the home page, and thus the homepage was changed in our final prototype to more of a welcoming screen. The homepage now shows highlights of the day and has media of the dog to excite dog owners about opening the mobile app up.
                The scheduling page stayed functionally the same, but was improved aesthetically based on our usability testing.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>During our research, we found that our typical users wanted a hands-off approach taking care of their dogs while they were away yet still being able to interact with their dogs. Automation was therefore key, while at the same time providing the high level of functionality that the sorts of tasks revolving around pet care required. We found our potential users would often be paying someone to come to their house while the user was away, and do the sorts of the things and solve the sorts of problems that our product aims to do.</p>
                <p>
                In order to offer the same ease of use, while still being capable of accomplishing these same tasks, we recognized we would need a product that was robust and capable of performing tasks such as; navigating the space of a typical home, recognizing various objects within a home, opening doors, closing doors, recognizing when doors are open or closed, finding a dog dish inside of a home, finding dog toys inside of a home, using a dog toy to play with a dog, filling a dog dish with food, finding and having the capacity to broadcast video of a dog. We also needed a way for a user to automate as many of these processes as they desired, while still maintaining the ability to take over with a sort of manual control for personal interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                The biggest limitation of our project is the cost overhead of developing this technology. This isn’t something we’re approaching in designing it, but the closest product in the real world, Boston Dynamic’s Robot MiniSpot, costs ~$22k. This is not very affordable in terms of what our goals are. The technology in creating one of these robots is still in development and is highly dependent on things like machine learning and computer vision. In future projects, we believe that one thing we will work on minimizing is the cost of creating this robot without trading too much functionality. Making it more realistic and affordable would be a big focus.
                </p>
                <p>One of the main ways that our project can evolve in the future is taking advantage of the constantly evolving technology that is developed for automated robots. This technology is undergoing large amounts of investment and has a large community dedicated to bringing technology to consumers at affordable prices. We expect to see the cost to produce, and therefore the cost of sale consistently decrease in the coming years. Likewise, battery technology is ever improving, providing for longer times without needed to recharge. This should allow us to increase our potential user base as the product becomes more and more affordable. We will add more functionality to our application in the future, but it’s core is built, and will be adaptable to future hardware designs. However fancy someone’s robot is, they’ll still want to schedule events, and look at a live feed of their dog.</p>
