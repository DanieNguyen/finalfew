                    <p>With my team, I built a messaging mobile app with instant translation built in so users can easily message people from other countries. The purpose of the app is to connect people across borders and also provide a practical application for new language learners.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>At the Dubhacks 2018 Hackathon, the challenge was to design anything that is for social good, so I created Piaro with my team. Piaro is a
            mobile messaging application that automatically translates messages allowing people who speak different languages to
            communicate with one another. Piaro allows:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>people from different parts of the world to connect like pen pals</li>
            <li>people staying in a foreign place (such as refugees and immigrants) to communicate with their new community</li>
            <li>travelers who are curious to find out information directly from a citizen</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I came up with this idea, using personal experience of not being able to communicate with my grand parents and
            knowledge from my Project ARTogether internship. I led a team of two other software developers to implement my idea
            using the Google Translation API and together, we have created a high fidelity mockup. Please check out my design
            process below and play with the interactive mockup!</p>

            <h3>My Design Process</h3>
            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p class="mb-4 pb-4">Since this project was created at the Dubhacks Hackathon, it was one of many ideas that my team brainstormed. As I
            said above, my inspiration for this idea came from my knowledge of refugees in America from the Project ARTogether
            internship. For refugees in San Francisco, it is hard to connect to those around them because of a language barrier.
            I, myself have problems communicating with my grandparents as well because they only speak Vietnamese and not
            English. This was a social issue that I felt needed to be tackled and could be tackled with the time constraints of a
            hackathon.</p>
            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p>Because of the time constraints, I was unable to do user research on this project. I went right into designing the
            information architecture and wireframes for the idea. However, as I was working, I was exploring paths about how to
            make the interface with my team and making sure that people of all areas could easily navigate it. I tried as much as
            possible to put myself in the shoes of a potential user while designing. Since it was all on the fly, I kept having
            to add more wireframes. Initially, I was only going for around 10 basic screens, but I was constantly adding more
            because of possible user interactions I saw. I ended up with 44 wireframes that detail all the possible interactions
            in our application.</p>
            <h4>Features</h4>
            <p>While designing the wireframes, I kept in mind three key features that I wanted to implement. I wanted
            to make sure the translation was instant, users would have recommened friends, and that users could easily search and
            add new friends. These three features would ensure that Piaro could work for those who need pen pals, help talking to
            their neighbors, and information from a certain area. Below are the descriptions and functionality of these features.</p>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Instant Translation
                </p>
                <p>Users have the options of setting their default language that all their incoming messages
                will be translated to. No manual translations needed! However, users can view the original text by tapping and
                holding on the message if they would like.
                </p>
                <div class="col-6 center">
                    <a href="images/translated.png" class="lightbox">
                        <img class="gallery" src="images/translated.png" alt="sample of a message thread">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <div class="col-6 center">
                    <a href="images/untranslated.png" class="lightbox">
                        <img class="gallery" src="images/untranslated.png" alt="viewing original text">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>Friends
                </p>
                <p>Users will be matched to recommended friends on their home feed. These friends are found
                based on the information from the user quiz (which is retakeable) and user profiles. These new pals will always
                have
                something in common with you!
                </p>
                <div class="col-6 center">
                    <a href="images/profile.png" class="lightbox">
                        <img class="gallery" src="images/profile.png" alt="sample profile page">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <div class="col-6 center">
                    <a href="images/friends.png" class="lightbox">
                        <img class="gallery" src="images/friends.png" alt="friends list">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <p">Search
                </p>
                <p>Users can easily search for other users, using a phone number, 4 digit ID number, or city.
                This way, if you want to talk to someone you already know with a language barrier, you can with Piaro. For
                travelers
                who want to know the best places to go in a certain city, Piaro can definitely help.
                </p>

                    </a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>User Testing</h4>
            <p>At the Dubhacks competition, despite not being about to do user research, I was able to do user testing with mentors
            from technology companies. I learned a lot about the nuances I needed to consider including the translation aspects
            of our application. I was able to improve my designs to make it more usable for the global users, by incorporating
            pictures and clear icons. </p>
            <h4>Software Development</h4>
            <p>While I focused on the designs of Piaro, my team members were working on the back end of the project. They were
            figuring out how to utilize the Google Translation API and connect it to a messaging application. During their work,
            I was assisting them by clarifying the specific features and functionality of Piaro.</p>

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>I had a great time participating in Dubhacks 2018, and I hope to continue to go to more hackathons. I learned a lot through the competition, thanks to all the wonderful mentors and students around me. Before Dubhacks, I felt like all designs had to be perfect, I would spend hours thinking about what could be changed and improved. This mindset, while still important, can be limiting to brainstorming and flexible design. Luckily, at Dubhacks, I was able to let go of this mindset because of the time crunch and focus on the bigger picture of designing, which I believe is solving problems and improving people's lives.
