                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Because the project is not yet complete, I am not allowed to share much information about the details for security reasons. However, at a high level, I worked with my team to define several features - System Settings, Bluetooth, Sirius XM, and some smaller features - for the infotainment system. I was also involved in user research and design exploration for a part of my internship. My deliverables for the team include wireframes, user flows, UX behavioral documentation for the developers, user research notes, and design improvements in their existing infotainment platform base.</p>
                <p>Through this internship, I was able to enhance my skills in identifying user flows and patterns, creating large information architectural systems, technical writing, designing low fidelity mock-ups, presenting design documentations, and problem solving with real-world constraints.</p>

                <h3>My Design Process at Garmin</h3>
                <p>I was the primary UX designer for three main elements of the infotainment system - System Settings, Bluetooth, and Sirius XM. I worked with my mentor and team and designed these features' functions, layouts, flows, and interactions.</p>
                <p>Going into this internship, I was eager to apply what I learned in school in the real-world industry. However, my main priority was learning as much as I could from my team and identify their design process. Because of my inclination to learn, my design process at Garmin was very reactive, instead of proactive.</p>

                <h4>Identifying the Foundation</h4>
                <p>For the various elements I worked on, my initial step was always to identify and understand any work that has been done on it. Over the years, there has been detailed research and thoughtful design done at Garmin that I wanted to make sure I built on. </p>

                <h4>Understanding the Context</h4>
                <p>With previous documentation, I would independently analyze the work then confirm my notes with my team. My team members were immensely helpful because they were the ones who created these design elements and interactions. In our discussions, I discovered several constraints, concerns, and factors affecting our possibilities.</p>

                <h4>Evaluating the Requirements</h4>
                <p>When I felt confident in my understanding of the feature and its existing iterations, I would then bring into considerations the requirements of the project. Luckily, it was easy to see the requirements of the project because there was a large database of written system requirements for each feature.</p>

                <h4>Synthesizing Better Designs</h4>
                <p>Using elements of the foundation that fulfilled the system requirements, I would organize low-fidelity wireframes and define what features needed to be added or improved in terms of layout, information architecture, and ease of use. I held many impromptu design reviews for my feature documentation with my team members to gain their insight and feedback.</p>

                <h4>Bringing in Technical Perspectives</h4>
                <p>With my feature documentation approved by the UX team, I would present the documentation to the developers assigned to the feature. Our developers also had a great history of development and interaction with Garmin products, so they would have great questions and revisions for the feature based on technical limitations.</p>

                <h4>Revising my Deliverables</h4>
                <p>Considering the constraints discussed by our developers, I would revise the feature documentation, occasionally redesigning the feature completely. Once the document was approved by the developers, they began software development. However, I would receive emails when our developers found new complications with the feature, so this last step was never really over.</p>

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Going into this internship, I wasn't sure what to expect given that it was going to be my first time working, living alone, in the Midwest, cooking for myself, and many other firsts. But I'm glad I decided to go through with this internship which was out of my comfort zone because I grew a lot as a person and a designer. I am grateful that I was able to experience and learn different perspectives from my team members and others at Garmin. </p>
