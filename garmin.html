                <p>During my time at Garmin, I was treated as a full time User Experience Designer in terms of workload and project responsibilities. I worked with one other designer, a Senior User Experience Designer, on a client project to design and provide a full infotainment and navigation system (both software and hardware) for one of their vehicle lines.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Because the project is not yet complete, I am not allowed to share much information about the details for security reasons. However, at a high level, I worked with my team to define several features - System Settings, Bluetooth, Sirius XM, and some smaller features - for the infotainment system. I was also involved in user research and design exploration for a part of my internship. My deliverables for the team include wireframes, user flows, UX behavioral documentation for the developers, user research notes, and design improvements in their existing infotainment platform base.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Through this internship, I was able to enhance my skills in identifying user flows and patterns, creating large information architectural systems, technical writing, designing low fidelity mock-ups, presenting design documentations, and problem solving with real-world constraints.</p>
