                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Because the project is not yet complete, I am not allowed to share much information about the details for security reasons. However, at a high level, I worked with my team to define several features - System Settings, Bluetooth, Sirius XM, and some smaller features - for the infotainment system. I was also involved in user research and design exploration for a part of my internship. My deliverables for the team include wireframes, user flows, UX behavioral documentation for the developers, user research notes, and design improvements in their existing infotainment platform base.</p>
                <p>Through this internship, I was able to enhance my skills in identifying user flows and patterns, creating large information architectural systems, technical writing, designing low fidelity mock-ups, presenting design documentations, and problem solving with real-world constraints.</p>

                <h3>My Design Process at Garmin</h3>
                <p>I was the primary UX designer for three main elements of the infotainment system - System Settings, Bluetooth, and Sirius XM. I worked with my mentor and team and designed these features' functions, layouts, flows, and interactions.</p>
                <p>Going into this internship, I was eager to apply what I learned in school in the real-world industry. However, my main priority was learning as much as I could from my team and identify their design process. Because of my inclination to learn, my design process at Garmin was very reactive, instead of proactive.</p>
                <h4>Identifying the Foundation</h4>
                <p>For the various elements I worked on, my initial step was always to identify and understand any work that has been done on it. The UX team at Garmin had a great design foundation for me to build on for my project because of the extensive history of the company. Over the years, there has been detailed research and thoughtful design done that I wanted to make sure I built on. </p>
                <h4>Understanding the Context</h4>
                <p>Once I found the foundation of work done on a feature, I would independently analyze the work then confirm my notes with my team. My team members were immensely helpful because often they were the ones who created these design elements and interactions. During this step, I was never afraid to identify areas for improvement that I noticed in terms of accessibility, ease of use, and intuitiveness. I would ask my team members the reasoning behind why it was implemented like that and discovered several constraints, concerns, and factors affecting our possibilities.</p>
                <h4>Evaluating the Requirements</h4>
                <p>When I felt confident in my understanding of the feature and its existing iterations, I would then bring into considerations the requirements of the project. </p>
                <h4>Synthesizing Better Designs</h4>
                <h4>Bringing in Technical Perspectives</h4>
                <h4>Revising my Deliverables</h4>
